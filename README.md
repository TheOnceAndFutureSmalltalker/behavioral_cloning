# Udacity Self Driving Car Behavioral Cloning Project

This project involves using an AI program to mimic human driving behavior.  A driving simulator software program is used to record the behavior of a human driving a car.  The data captured is images from cameras mounted on the car as well as throttle, brake, steering angle, and speed.   This data is then used to train a neural network to drive the car as well as a human.

## Instructions

Currently, this repository does not contain all required dependencies, support files, and instructions for actually running the simulation.  This to come later.
